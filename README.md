[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/tplinkrouterc6u?period=total&units=international_system&left_color=grey&right_color=orange&left_text=Downloads)](https://pypi.org/project/tplinkrouterc6u/)
![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/tplinkrouterc6u)

## Installation
`pip install tplinkrouterc6u`

## Dependencies
 - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
 - [pycryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/)

## Usage
Enter the host & credentials used to log in to your router management page. Username is admin by default. But you may pass username as third parameter

```python
from tplinkrouterc6u import TplinkRouterProvider, TplinkC1200Router, Wifi
from logging import Logger

router = TplinkRouterProvider.get_client('http://192.168.0.1', 'password')
# You may use client directly like
# router = TplinkRouter('http://192.168.0.1', 'password')
# You may also pass username if it is different and a logger to log errors as
# router = TplinkRouter('http://192.168.0.1','password','admin2', Logger('test'))
# If you have the TP-link C1200 V2 or similar, you can use the TplinkC1200Router class instead of the TplinkRouter class.
# Remember that the password for this router is different, here you need to use the web encrypted password.
# To get web encrypted password, read Web Encrypted Password section
# router = TplinkC1200Router('http://192.168.0.1','WebEncryptedPassword', Logger('test'))

try:
    router.authorize()  # authorizing
    # Get firmware info - returns Firmware
    firmware = router.get_firmware()

    # Get status info - returns Status
    status = router.get_status()
    if not status.guest_2g_enable:  # check if guest 2.4G wifi is disable
        router.set_wifi(Wifi.WIFI_GUEST_2G, True)  # turn on guest 2.4G wifi

    # Get Address reservations, sort by ipaddr
    reservations = router.get_ipv4_reservations()
    reservations.sort(key=lambda a: a.ipaddr)
    for res in reservations:
        print(f"{res.macaddr} {res.ipaddr:16s} {res.hostname:36} {'Permanent':12}")

    # Get DHCP leases, sort by ipaddr
    leases = router.get_ipv4_dhcp_leases()
    leases.sort(key=lambda a: a.ipaddr)
    for lease in leases:
        print(f"{lease.macaddr} {lease.ipaddr:16s} {lease.hostname:36} {lease.lease_time:12}")
finally:
    router.logout()  # always logout as TP-Link Web Interface only supports upto 1 user logged
```

The TP-Link Web Interface only supports upto 1 user logged in at a time (for security reasons, apparently).
So before action you need to authorize and after logout

### <a id="encrypted_pass">Web Encrypted Password</a>
If you got exception - `You need to use web encrypted password instead. Check the documentation!`
or you have TP-link C1200 V2 or similar router you need to get web encrypted password by these actions:
1. Go to the login page of your router. (default: 192.168.0.1).
2. Type in the password you use to login into the password field.
3. Click somewhere else on the page so that the password field is not selected anymore.
4. Open the JavaScript console of your browser (usually by pressing F12 and then clicking on "Console").
5. Type `document.getElementById("login-password").value;`
6. Copy the returned value as password and use it.

Guidelines [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/AlexandrErohin/TP-Link-Archer-C6U/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Local Development

- Download this repository.
- Run `pip install -e path/to/repo`.
- Make changes to files within the `tplinkrouter6u` directory.
- Exercise the changes following the "Usage" section above.

The sanity check test.py illustrates a few tests and runs through a list of queries in queries.txt creating logs of the results of each query in the logs folder. This can be used to capture the dictionary output of all cgi-bin form submissions.

### Run tests
- Run `python -m unittest discover ./test`
